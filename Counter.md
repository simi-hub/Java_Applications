Actual Question

Create and compile a class called Counter.  An object of this class is used to count things, so it records a count that is a nonnegative whole number.  Include methods to set the count to 0, to increase the count by 1, and to decrease the count by 1.  Be sure that no method allows the counter to become negative.  Also, include an accessor method that returns the current count value, as well as a method that displays the count on the screen.  Do not define an input method.  The only method that can set the counter is the one that sets it to 0.  (Hint:  You need only one instance variable.)

Then, create, compile, and run a class that tests your Counter class.  You should instantiate the Counter class in a test class.  Your test class should reset the counter, increase it a few times, then decrease it a few times.  Print the counter in between to verify that your counter class is doing what it should.
