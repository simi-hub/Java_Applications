This is just a program that contains a bunch of methods. I am able to learn how to write methods

Actual Question

Write a method header to create a method that

Has the name “twice” and returns twice its integer argument.

Has the name “isBig” and returns true if its integer argument is greater than 10,000.

Has the name “printResult” and prints the value of its only integer argument.

Has the name “readCount” and reads an integer and returns that integer.

Has the name “inOrder” and returns true if the first integer argument is smaller than the second integer argument and false
otherwise.
--Adds its two integer arguments and returns the sum

Writes the name and age of a dog. The first argument to the method is the (String) name of the dog, and the second is its (integer) age.

Has the name “nextDay” and returns the next day after the string argument that tells which day today is.
