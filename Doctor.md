This question focuses on being able to understand inheritance and creating derived classes

Actual Question

Define a class named Doctor whose objects are records for a clinic’s doctors. Derive this class from the class Person given in Listing 8.1.  It's also posted here in this module.  A Doctor record has the doctor’s name–defined in the class Person,—a specialty as a String (Pediatrician, Obstetrician, General Practitioner, and so on--these are just examples.  The type is String.), and an office-visit fee (use the type double). Give your class a constructor and one accessor method and one mutator method.  Also create a toString method. Write a test program that tests all your methods.
